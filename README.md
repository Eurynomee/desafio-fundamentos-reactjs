# desafio-fundamentos-reactjs

To make this react application run you'll need to get the [backend](https://github.com/Eurynomee/gostack-desafio06) also so be sure to go there and follow the steps to make the server work.


To make this application run on your computer you'll just need to:

run 
```
yarn
```
install all dependencies.

And hit

``` 
yarn start
```
to make the application run on your main browser.


You can find a .csv as a model on the folder CSV to see how to set a import file.
